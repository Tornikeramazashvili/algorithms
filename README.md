# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction

I've decided to document various algorithms and data structures in JavaScript to illustrate their impact on performance, scalability, and overall code quality.

Feel free to learn from, share, and use this information in your own projects or however you see fit.

In 1 section we start with Big O notation to analyze the performance of an algorithm, and compare how algorithms scale with input size, ensuring they are efficient, scalable, and effective, among other factors.
