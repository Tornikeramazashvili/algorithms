# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction

I've decided to document various algorithms and data structures in JavaScript to illustrate their impact on performance, scalability, and overall code quality.

Feel free to learn from, share, and use this information in your own projects or however you see fit.

## Folders and Files Sequence

**1. Big O Notation**: This folder contains resources related to Big 0 notation, including explanations and examples.

- **timeComplexity.js**: This file explores the concept of time complexity in greater detail, explaining how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases. It includes examples with different time complexities.

- **spaceComplexity.js**: This file explains space complexity, discussing how much additional memory is needed to run the code. It includes examples of primitives and reference types, highlighting their space requirements and differences.
