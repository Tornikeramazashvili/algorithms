# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction

I've decided to document various algorithms and data structures in JavaScript to illustrate their impact on performance, scalability, and overall code quality.

Feel free to learn from, share, and use this information in your own projects or however you see fit.

## Folders and Files Sequence

**1. Big O Notation**: This folder contains resources related to Big O notation, including explanations and examples.

- **Introduction.js**: This file provides an introduction to Big O notation and demonstrates the difference between \(O(n)\) and \(O(1)\) time complexities using two implementations of a function that calculates the sum of integers.
